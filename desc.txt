this project aimed at building a distributed load testing system using kafka as the central communication service. this is relevent as the load tests need to be performed to tell how good a website is. this project is scalable as we can extend the driver nodes upto 9. we have implemented this using golang, which is the industries choice for building distributed systems.

two types of load tests can be conducted, avalanche and tsunami. the tsunami tests were implemented in this way: we introduced a delay between each request using time.sleep


1. Project Introduction:
The project is a Distributed Load-Testing System designed to simulate high-concurrency, high-throughput scenarios on a web server to evaluate its performance 
under stress. This system allows users to orchestrate and execute complex load tests across multiple driver nodes in a scalable and coordinated manner. The 
project leverages Kafka as a messaging backbone for robust communication between the orchestrator and the driver nodes. The motivation behind this project
stems from the increasing demand for scalable and reliable web services in the market, where load testing is essential to ensure that services can handle 
peak traffic without degrading performance or availability.

2. Modules Description:
The project is divided into several key modules:

Orchestrator Module: Acts as the central controller, managing test configurations, distributing tasks to driver nodes, and aggregating results.
It also exposes a REST API for initiating tests and viewing results.

Driver Node Module: These nodes are responsible for generating the actual load on the target web server. Each driver node operates independently but in coordination with the orchestrator, sending a specified number of requests to the server and reporting back the performance metrics.

Kafka Communication Module: Kafka is used for messaging between the orchestrator and driver nodes. Different Kafka topics are used to handle heartbeats, registrations, test configurations, triggers, and metrics, ensuring that the system is both scalable and fault-tolerant.

WebSocket Module: Provides real-time updates to the users via a WebSocket connection, allowing them to monitor the progress and status of the load tests
in real-time.

3. Advantages and the Main Functionality of Your Application:
The main functionality of this application is to perform distributed load testing in a scalable and automated manner. The key advantages include:

Scalability: The system can scale from a few driver nodes to many, depending on the testing requirements.
Real-Time Monitoring: Users can monitor test progress and performance metrics in real-time.
Flexibility: Supports different types of load tests (e.g., Tsunami and Avalanche testing), allowing users to simulate various load scenarios.
Fault Tolerance: Kafkaâ€™s distributed nature ensures that the system remains resilient even if some components fail.
Flowchart Explanation:

Orchestrator sends test configurations to Driver Nodes via Kafka.
Driver Nodes execute the test and send metrics back to the Orchestrator.
Orchestrator aggregates the results and updates the real-time dashboard through WebSockets.

4. Tools, Technologies, and Platform Used:
Programming Language: Go (Golang)
Messaging: Apache Kafka (with ZooKeeper)
Web Framework: Gorilla Web Toolkit (for WebSockets and HTTP handling)
Real-Time Communication: WebSockets
Monitoring and Logging: Kafka Consumer and WebSocket broadcasting
Deployment: Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
Platform: Linux-based servers for hosting the application

5. Personal Contribution and Your Role in the Project:
I played a central role in the project, specifically in designing and implementing the Orchestrator Module. I was responsible for the integration with Kafka, 
handling test configurations, managing driver nodes, and aggregating metrics. I also implemented the WebSocket module for real-time communication, ensuring users
could receive live updates on test progress.

6. Challenges in the Project:
It would have been simpler to execute the project without implementing websockets, but since the professors wanted it we executed, without it we could have directly using http requests and responses
The client periodically sends HTTP GET requests to the server to check for new data.
The interval between requests is determined by the client and can be adjusted based on the application's needs (e.g., every few seconds).
but we implemented websockets as follows:
WebSocket Connection Handling: The server upgrades HTTP connections to WebSocket connections using the Gorilla WebSocket toolkit and tracks active connections in a thread-safe manner.
Real-Time Communication: WebSockets allow the server to push updates to clients instantly, enabling real-time monitoring of the load tests.
Concurrency Management: The server uses a mutex to ensure that the map of active WebSocket clients is accessed and modified safely across multiple goroutines.
Broadcasting Messages: The server can send messages to all connected clients, ensuring that they are all kept up-to-date with the latest information about the load tests.
----------------------------------------

              WebSocket Connection State Handling :-

[WebSockets are a communication protocol that provides a full-duplex, persistent connection between a client (such as a web browser) and a server]
Connection Handling: The project establishes and maintains WebSocket connections effectively, but could benefit from more explicit handling of disconnections and reconnections.
Disconnection Handling:explicitly remove clients from the active connections list when they disconnect.
Reconnection Handling: (currently not implemented) The server should be prepared to accept reconnections from clients, with the client taking responsibility for attempting to reconnect.   [Reconnection Handling ------>>>>>>
Client-Side Reconnection: Handling reconnections is typically the responsibility of the client. The client can attempt to reconnect if it detects that the WebSocket connection has been closed. This is not part of the server code, but you would need to ensure that the server is ready to accept new connections from clients that are attempting to reconnect.
Server Readiness: Ensure that the server is capable of handling repeated connections from the same client. This might involve clearing out old connection state or ensuring that new connections do not encounter issues due to lingering old state<<<<<<]
Dropped Connections: Error handling in message broadcasting is already implemented, ensuring that dropped connections are detected and handled by removing the client from the list.
Network Interruptions: Periodic ping messages can help detect and handle network interruptions, ensuring that stale connections are closed.




           KAFKA AND WEBSOCKETS COEXIST

How Kafka and WebSockets Can Coexist
Kafka: Handles the core messaging between distributed components (e.g., orchestrator and driver nodes). It ensures reliable, scalable communication for the load testing process.
WebSockets: Could be layered on top of this infrastructure to provide real-time updates and interactive control to user interfaces, ensuring that end-users have a responsive experience when interacting with the system.

-----------------------------------------

7. The Number of People in the Project:
The project was developed by a team of four. While each member had specific roles, we collaborated closely to integrate our modules and ensure the system's overall coherence. My role primarily focused on the orchestrator and communication infrastructure.

8. Amount of Time It Took for the Project:
The project took approximately three WEEKS from inception to completion. This included the time for planning, development, testing, and deployment. The initial phase focused on designing the system architecture, followed by iterative development and testing.

9. Improvements in the Future for the Present System:
In the future, the system could handle Client-Side Reconnection: Handling reconnections is typically the responsibility of the client. The client can attempt to reconnect if it detects that the WebSocket connection has been closed.

10. Drawbacks:
One limitation of the current system is its reliance on Kafka, which, while robust, adds complexity to the deployment and management of the system. Also, the real-time WebSocket updates, while useful, could lead to performance issues under extremely high loads if not properly managed. However, these are areas identified for future optimization, and the system is designed with modularity in mind to allow for such improvements.

Complexity in Implementation and Maintenance
Stateful Connections: WebSockets require the server to maintain a persistent connection with each client, leading to increased complexity in managing these connections, particularly when scaling the application to handle many concurrent users.

--------------------------------------------

              CORS HEADERS

Purpose: The addCorsHeaders function is a middleware that adds CORS headers to HTTP responses, allowing cross-origin requests from any origin.
Effect: It ensures that browsers can make requests to this server from any origin, which is especially useful if the server's API needs to be accessed by web applications hosted on different domains.
CORS Headers: The headers specify that the server allows requests from any origin (*), supports POST and OPTIONS methods, and accepts the Content-Type header in requests.
Restricted CORS: This updated version restricts cross-origin requests to only the specified allowedOrigins.
Security: By specifying allowed origins, you prevent unauthorized or unwanted domains from making requests to your server, enhancing security.
Flexibility: You can easily update the list of allowed origins based on your requirements.
--------------------------------------------

              OS CONCEPTS

1. Concurrency and Parallelism
Goroutines: Go's goroutines are a lightweight concurrency mechanism that allows multiple functions to run concurrently. In your project, goroutines were used to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, such as managing WebSocket connections, processing Kafka messages, and monitoring the health of driver nodes. This is akin to multi-threading in other languages but with much lower overhead, allowing for efficient parallelism.
Synchronization: Mutexes (like sync.Mutex and sync.RWMutex) were used to ensure thread-safe access to shared resources, such as the WebSocketClients map or the list of active nodes. This prevents race conditions and ensures data consistency when multiple goroutines access or modify shared data.

2. Inter-process Communication (IPC)
Kafka Messaging: Kafka acts as a message broker, facilitating communication between different components (or processes) of your distributed system. Each driver node and the orchestrator communicate via Kafka, which is a form of IPC that enables decoupled, asynchronous message passing, allowing for scalable and fault-tolerant communication across the system.

3. Memory Management
Automatic Memory Management: Go's garbage collector handles memory management automatically, cleaning up unused memory allocations. This simplifies the development process by reducing the need to manually manage memory, which is particularly beneficial in a system that handles numerous concurrent operations and network connections.

4. Networking and Sockets
WebSockets: WebSocket connections are built on top of standard TCP sockets, a core OS concept. These sockets allow for persistent, full-duplex communication channels between the server and clients, enabling real-time updates in your application. The management of these connections (e.g., handling disconnections, reconnections, and message broadcasting) relies on OS-level networking capabilities.
HTTP and TCP/IP: The projectâ€™s server handles HTTP requests over TCP/IP, a fundamental OS concept that underpins all network communication. The use of HTTP allows clients to interact with the server via standard web protocols, while TCP/IP ensures reliable data transmission.

5. Process Management
Signal Handling: The project uses OS signals (like SIGINT and SIGTERM) to gracefully shut down the server and its components. This involves catching these signals and ensuring that ongoing processes are properly terminated, resources are released, and any necessary cleanup is performed before the application exits.
SIGINT (Signal Interrupt) :-
Purpose: SIGINT is a signal that is typically sent to a process by the user when they want to interrupt the process. This signal is most commonly generated by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal where the process is running.    -end-
SIGTERM (Signal Terminate) :-
Purpose: SIGTERM is a more general-purpose signal that is used to request the termination of a process. It is a way to politely ask a process to shut down. Unlike SIGKILL (which forcefully kills a process without giving it a chance to clean up), SIGTERM allows the process to catch the signal and terminate gracefully.Use Case: SIGTERM is commonly used by system administrators or orchestration tools (like Docker, Kubernetes, or systemd) to stop a process. It is the default signal sent by the kill command if no other signal is specified (kill <pid> sends SIGTERM by default).   -end-

6. File System Management
Persistent Storage: The project ensures the existence of directories (Test_Reports, Final_Test_Reports) for storing test results and reports. This involves interacting with the file system, a core OS concept, to create, read, and write files as necessary.
--------------------------------------------



   METRICS STORE

Components of the Metrics Store
Driver Nodes: Each driver node collects performance metrics as it generates load on the target server. These metrics are periodically sent to the orchestrator via Kafka.
Kafka Topics: Metrics from the driver nodes are published to a dedicated Kafka topic (e.g., metrics). This allows for asynchronous and reliable communication, ensuring that all collected data is delivered to the orchestrator even in the presence of network or system failures.
Orchestrator: The orchestrator subscribes to the metrics Kafka topic and consumes the incoming metrics messages. It then processes and stores these metrics in a structured format.

Initial Metrics Storage :-
Purpose: This block checks if there are already stored aggregated metrics for the given TestID. If not, it initializes the storage for this TestID. If there are already metrics stored, it updates them by adding the new metrics to the existing totals.

Key Operations:

TotalRequests: The total number of requests sent by the node is accumulated.
MeanLatency: Latency values are added together, to be averaged later.
MinLatency & MaxLatency: The minimum and maximum latencies are updated by comparing current values with stored ones.
NumNodes: Tracks how many nodes have contributed metrics for this TestID.


Saving Aggregated Metrics to a File :-
Purpose: This section creates a JSON representation of the aggregated metrics and saves it to a file. The file is named according to the TestID and NodeID, which makes it easy to identify which metrics belong to which test and node.

Final Aggregation and Broadcasting :-
Final Aggregation: This part of the code checks if metrics from all active nodes have been received for the given TestID. If all nodes have reported their metrics, the mean latency is finalized by dividing the total by the number of nodes.

Broadcasting and Saving: The final aggregated metrics are broadcast to all connected clients using SendMessageToClients, and they are also saved to a JSON file for record-keeping.
-----------------------------------------------

     TSUNAMI TEST (main.go of driver)

Setting Up the Test :-
Interval Setup: The interval variable is set based on TestMessageDelay from the testConfig. This defines the delay between consecutive requests in milliseconds.
Request Count: numRequests is set to the number of requests that each driver node should send, as specified in testConfig.
URL: The target URL for the HTTP requests is set to "https://github.com" (this could be replaced with the actual URL being tested)   VVV IMP

Metric Collection Arrays :-

allLatencies: An array that accumulates the latencies of all requests sent during the test. This is used to calculate overall metrics like mean, min, and max latency.
currentLatencies: An array that temporarily stores the latencies of requests sent during the current interval before the metrics are published.

Metric Producer Setup :-
Metric Producer: metricProducer is an instance of a MetricProducer, which is likely responsible for publishing metrics to some external system (e.g., a Kafka topic or a database).
Goroutine for Metric Reporting: A separate goroutine is launched to periodically calculate and publish metrics based on the collected latencies. This allows the metrics to be reported asynchronously while the main loop continues to send requests.
Metric Calculation: Inside the goroutine, if there are latencies in currentLatencies, the function calculates the mean, min, and max latency using the calculateLatencyMetrics function.
Metric Message Creation: A MetricMessage struct is created and populated with the calculated metrics, the node ID, test ID, and the number of requests sent so far (req). This message is then published by the metricProducer.
Reset: After publishing, the currentLatencies array is cleared, and req is reset to 0.

Performing the HTTP Requests :-
Request Loop: The main loop runs for the number of requests specified by numRequests.
Latency Measurement: For each request, the time taken (latency) is measured by recording the time before and after the http.Get request and calculating the difference.
Storing Latency: The measured latency is stored in currentLatencies, and the request counter (req) is incremented.
Delay Between Requests: The time.After(interval) function introduces a delay between each request, simulating the controlled, gradual increase in load characteristic of a "Tsunami" test.

-----------------------------------------------


        

     AVALANCHE TEST (main.go of driver)

Function Initialization :-
Request Counter: The variable req is initialized to count the number of requests made.
Test Announcement: A message is printed to indicate the start of the Avalanche test for the given TestID.
Target URL: The URL to which HTTP requests will be sent is set to "https://github.com" (this can be modified to the actual target server in a real test scenario).
Number of Requests: The numRequests variable is set based on the MessageCountPerDriver in testConfig, indicating how many requests each node should send.


Metric Collection Arrays :-
allLatencies: This array stores the latency of all requests made during the test. It's used to calculate cumulative metrics like mean, min, and max latency.
currentLatencies: This array temporarily stores the latencies for the current set of requests before they are aggregated and reported.


Metric Producer Setup:-
Metric Producer: An instance of MetricProducer is created. This object is responsible for publishing the calculated metrics to an external system (e.g., a database, a monitoring system, or a messaging queue like Kafka).

Periodic Metric Reporting:-
Goroutine for Metrics: A separate goroutine is used to periodically process and publish metrics based on the collected latencies.
Locking: A mutex (current_latency_mutex) is used to ensure that access to the currentLatencies array is thread-safe, preventing race conditions when adding latencies or publishing metrics.
Metric Calculation: The latencies are appended to allLatencies, and then the calculateLatencyMetrics function computes the mean, min, and max latency.
Metric Message Creation: A MetricMessage is created, containing the calculated metrics, the node ID, and the test ID. This message is then published using the metricProducer.
Reset for Next Interval: After publishing the metrics, the currentLatencies array is cleared, and req is reset for the next set of requests.

Performing HTTP Requests:-
Request Loop: The main loop sends the specified number of HTTP GET requests to the target URL.
Latency Measurement: For each request, the latency (time taken for the request to complete) is measured by recording the time before and after the HTTP request.
Latency Storage: The measured latency is added to currentLatencies, and req is incremented to keep track of the total number of requests made.
Concurrency Control: The current_latency_mutex ensures that adding latencies to currentLatencies is thread-safe.

Why These Tools and Technologies Were Preferred
Programming Language: Go (Golang)

Reason for Choosing: Go was chosen for its strong concurrency model, ease of use, and performance characteristics. Goâ€™s goroutines and channels provide a simple yet powerful way to manage concurrent tasks, which is essential in a distributed load-testing system where multiple driver nodes are operating simultaneously. Additionally, Goâ€™s compiled nature results in fast execution and low resource consumption, making it ideal for a system that needs to handle high throughput and low latency.
Messaging: Apache Kafka (with ZooKeeper)

Reason for Choosing: Kafka is a highly scalable, distributed messaging system that can handle large volumes of data with high throughput and low latency. It is designed for fault tolerance, making it reliable in a distributed environment. Kafkaâ€™s partitioning and consumer group features make it well-suited for coordinating tasks across multiple driver nodes in the load-testing system. The decision to use ZooKeeper was driven by the need to maintain a traditional Kafka setup, given its mature support and widespread use in production environments.
Web Framework: Gorilla Web Toolkit

Reason for Choosing: The Gorilla Web Toolkit was selected because it is one of the most robust and widely-used web frameworks in the Go ecosystem. It provides powerful tools for handling WebSockets, HTTP routing, and middleware, all of which are critical components of the project. The toolkitâ€™s modular design and ease of integration with other Go libraries made it a natural choice for building the web-based components of the system.
Real-Time Communication: WebSockets

Reason for Choosing: WebSockets were chosen for real-time communication because they provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection. This is particularly useful for providing real-time updates to users during a load test, allowing the server to push updates to the client as soon as they are available. WebSockets offer lower latency compared to traditional HTTP polling, making them ideal for applications that require immediate feedback.
Monitoring and Logging: Kafka Consumer and WebSocket Broadcasting

Reason for Choosing: The Kafka Consumer was used for its reliability and ability to handle large-scale log processing. By consuming messages from Kafka topics, the system can effectively monitor the status of the driver nodes and orchestrate the load tests. WebSocket broadcasting was chosen to send real-time logs and status updates to the users, providing transparency and immediate insight into the systemâ€™s operations.

---------------------------------------------------

         ZOOKEEPER

ZooKeeper in Your Project
ZooKeeper's Role:

Cluster Coordination: ZooKeeper is responsible for managing and coordinating the Kafka brokers in your cluster. It keeps track of which brokers are alive, manages broker metadata, and handles leader election for partitions.
Leader Election: ZooKeeper decides which broker becomes the leader for a given partition. This leader is then responsible for handling all read and write operations for that partition.
Configuration Management: ZooKeeper stores and manages configurations for topics, partitions, and brokers.
Kafka Brokers' Role:

Message Handling: The Kafka brokers in your project are primarily focused on handling the production, storage, and consumption of messages.
Reliance on ZooKeeper: The brokers depend on ZooKeeper for instructions on how to manage themselves and the data they are handling. Without ZooKeeper, the brokers wouldnâ€™t be able to coordinate and manage the cluster effectively.
Implications for Your Project
ZooKeeper Dependency: Your projectâ€™s Kafka cluster is dependent on ZooKeeper for its stability and operation. If ZooKeeper experiences issues, the entire Kafka cluster could be affected, impacting the reliability of your load-testing system.

Operational Considerations: When managing your Kafka cluster, you need to ensure that ZooKeeper is healthy and properly configured. This includes monitoring ZooKeeperâ€™s performance, managing its configuration, and ensuring it is resilient to failures.

Moving Forward
Given that ZooKeeper is part of your project, youâ€™ll need to account for it in your operational planning and system monitoring. If you ever consider upgrading to a newer Kafka version that supports KRaft, you could eliminate the need for ZooKeeper in the future, simplifying your architecture. However, for now, ZooKeeper remains a critical component of your Kafka setup.

-----------------------------------------------------------


       SCALABILTY

Kafkaâ€™s Role in Scalability
Scalable Data Ingestion: As driver nodes publish metrics, heartbeats, and other messages to Kafka topics, Kafkaâ€™s partitioning and distributed nature ensure that the system can handle an increasing amount of data without performance degradation.
Topic-Based Coordination: By using Kafka topics for coordination (e.g., registration, test configuration, metrics, and heartbeat topics), the system allows for distributed and parallel processing. This means that as you add more driver nodes, the system can handle the increased load by distributing messages across more partitions.

Horizontal Scaling
Adding Nodes: One of the primary methods of scaling in your system is by adding more driver nodes. The orchestrator and Kafka infrastructure are designed to support this, allowing the system to handle more concurrent requests and generate a higher load on the target server.
Scalable Configuration: The systemâ€™s ability to scale is also enhanced by the fact that you can change the number of driver nodes between tests, allowing you to adapt the scale of your testing to the needs of each specific scenario.

-----------------------------------------------------------------


    FAULT TOLERANCE 

Kafka provides robust fault tolerance through data replication, partitioning, and consumer group management, ensuring that message processing can continue even if parts of the Kafka cluster fail.
Redundant driver nodes ensure that the system continues to generate load even if some nodes fail, with the orchestrator detecting and handling these failures.
Network resilience is achieved through retry mechanisms, timeouts, and connection management, allowing the system to recover from temporary issues.
Data integrity is maintained through atomic operations and durable message storage, ensuring consistency even during concurrent operations.
Monitoring and graceful shutdown ensure that the system can detect failures, alert administrators, and recover from issues without data loss.


1. Kafka's Built-in Fault Tolerance
Replication of Data: Kafka inherently supports fault tolerance through the replication of topics across multiple brokers. This means that if one Kafka broker fails, the data is still available on other brokers, ensuring that the system can continue to operate without data loss.
Partitioning: Kafkaâ€™s partitioning mechanism allows data to be distributed across multiple brokers. If a broker fails, another broker can take over, ensuring that the messages continue to be processed.
Consumer Group Offsets: Kafka consumers commit their offsets periodically, allowing them to resume from where they left off in the event of a failure, rather than starting from the beginning.
2. Redundant Driver Nodes
Multiple Driver Nodes: By deploying multiple driver nodes, the system ensures that if one node fails, others can continue generating load. This redundancy ensures that the load test can proceed even if some nodes encounter issues.
Node Health Monitoring: The system uses a heartbeat mechanism where each driver node periodically sends heartbeat messages to the orchestrator. If a node fails to send a heartbeat within a specified time, the orchestrator can detect this and either redistribute the load to other nodes or notify the user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

   CONTAINERS

Your docker-compose.yml file does both: it creates new containers from Docker images and builds new containers from source code.

1. Using Existing Containers
For the zoo1 and kafka1 services, the file uses pre-built images from Docker Hub (or another registry) to create containers. Specifically:
zoo1 uses the image confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:7.3.2.
kafka1 uses the image confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.3.2.
Docker Compose will pull these images (if they aren't already available locally) and create containers from them.
2. Building and Creating New Containers
For the orchestrator and driver services, the file builds new containers from source code in your local directories:
The orchestrator service is built from the Dockerfile located in ./orchestrator.
The driver service is built from the Dockerfile located in ./driver.
Docker Compose will build these images using the Dockerfiles specified in those directories and then create containers from these newly built images.
Summary
Using Existing Containers: The zoo1 and kafka1 services pull existing images from a registry and create containers based on those images.
Building New Containers: The orchestrator and driver services are built from local Dockerfiles, creating new images that are then used to run containers.
So, your docker-compose.yml file is both creating new containers by building images from your code and using pre-existing containers from Docker images.
